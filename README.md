# PurgeBot
Written to purge user messages en masse.

To do:
- Tidy up code (especially after separating channelPurgeA and channelPurgeB into separate class
- ~~Make channelPurgeB allocate messages younger than two weeks to array sizes of 100 to take advantage of BulkDelete API~~
- ~~Create emote-based confirmation in command channel to command user~~
